Snakes & Ladders

Welcome everyone to Snakes & Ladders!

Snakes & Ladders is a game people of all ages are very familiar with. Players roll a die and navigate the board. The objective of the game is to reach the last square on the board. Shortcuts in the form of ladders will move you up the board faster and landing on a snake will take you back to a previous square.

As a kid I used to love playing with family and friends, so I decided to re-create the game for my first project.

Roll the die and test your luck!
